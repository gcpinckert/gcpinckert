### 👋 Hi! I'm Ginni.

I'm a full stack software engineer 👩‍💻 based in Los Angeles, CA. I use my experience as a Professional Organizer to write efficient and maintainable code that will 🫧tidy up🫧 complex problems.

Recently, I created [Edamame](https://get-edamame.com/) an open-source, distributed load testing framework, optimized for real-time collaboration apps that use both HTTP and WebSockets. Edamame supports up to 200,000 virtual users and processes more than a million data points per second in a near real-time data visualization pipeline.
